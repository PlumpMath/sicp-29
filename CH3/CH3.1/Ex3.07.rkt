;; @Brief:Consider the bank account objects created by make-account, with the password
;; modification described in exercise 3.3. Suppose that our banking system requires the ability to make joint
;; accounts. Define a procedure make-joint that accomplishes this. Make-joint should take three
;; arguments. The first is a password-protected account. The second argument must match the password with
;; which the account was defined in order for the make-joint operation to proceed. The third argument is
;; a new password. Make-joint is to create an additional access to the original account using the new
;; password. For example, if peter-acc is a bank account with password open-sesame, then
;; (define paul-acc
;;    (make-joint peter-acc 'open-sesame 'rosebud))
;; will allow one to make transactions on peter-acc using the name paul-acc and the password
;; rosebud. You may wish to modify your solution to exercise 3.3 to accommodate this new feature.
